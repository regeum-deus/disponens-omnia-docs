Welcome!
===================================

Game dev is a fickle beast with quitting points right and left. Umong the highest of these is project incoherency, the state of being your project falls into after you have 70 fucking clases that are all interlocking, and then your workflow falls to shit. Game devs shouldn't have to deal with this shit, in fact this is the reason I quit using unity, and moved to godot. But all game dev tools seem to have a common problem. OOP. Now while I'm never going to stop anyone from using oop, but I hate it, inheritance, polymorphism, it all adds to the incoherency of your projects, and the amount of uneeded features in these tools make actually finding the useful features extremely difficult. And as such, I am developing a tool on my own. Disponens omnia is the C of game dev. Low level, slim (*extremely so*), and performant.
